# Generate Release Notes
#
# This github action allows us to tag, create changelog, create a github release and notify slack Spacejam's slack channel.
# The event is triggered on demand or when a pull request has been closed on master.
# The "on closed" filter is temporary. A better solution would be to trigger on merge but the "pull request" action
# does not have this type available.
